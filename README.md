# How to

## Teacher example

Start the Fuseki server ***at path ./teacherExample***.

On Arch Linux, with the official https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/apache-jena-fuseki/
run simply:
```sh
cd ./teacherExample
fuseki-server
```

To run the app, run:
```sh
mvn exec:java
```

Note: this example was a little bit modified. Original version is at the first
commit of this repository.
1. I've deleted ejb dependencies (not useful for the example)
2. I've added a new maven goal: `mvn exec:java`. As it, this sample could
    be run without IDE dependency.
